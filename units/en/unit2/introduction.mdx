# Understanding MCP Architecture and Core Concepts

Welcome to Unit 2 of the MCP Course! In this unit, we'll dive deeper into the technical architecture and core concepts of the Model Context Protocol.

## What You Will Learn

In this unit, you will:

* Understand the client-server architecture of MCP and the roles of Hosts, Clients, and Servers
* Learn about MCP's core primitives: Tools, Resources, Prompts, and Sampling
* Explore the communication protocols that power MCP interactions
* Trace through a complete MCP interaction lifecycle
* Understand how these architectural components work together in real implementations

By the end of this unit, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of MCP's technical foundation, enabling you to build and integrate MCP components effectively.

## Why Architecture Matters

Understanding the architecture of MCP is crucial for several reasons:

* **Effective Implementation**: A clear mental model of how MCP components interact allows you to implement or integrate MCP correctly.
* **Troubleshooting**: Knowledge of the architecture helps you diagnose and fix issues when they arise.
* **Design Decisions**: Understanding the "why" behind MCP's design helps you make appropriate decisions for your use case.
* **Security Considerations**: The architecture has implications for security that are essential to understand before deployment.
* **Performance Optimization**: Knowing how data flows through MCP helps optimize for performance.

## The Components We'll Explore

MCP's architecture consists of several key components that work together to enable AI models to access external context and capabilities. In this unit, we'll examine:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: The foundational structure of MCP, including Hosts (the AI applications), Clients (protocol handlers within hosts), and Servers (providing capabilities).

2. **Core Primitives**: The fundamental building blocks of MCP interactions:
   - Tools: Executable functions the model can call
   - Resources: Data sources the application can access
   - Prompts: Pre-defined templates or workflows
   - Sampling: Server-initiated model interactions

3. **Communication Protocols**: The standardized methods for exchanging information:
   - JSON-RPC: The message format for requests, responses, and notifications
   - Transports: stdio (for local servers) and HTTP+SSE/Streamable HTTP (for remote servers)

4. **Interaction Lifecycle**: The sequence of steps in an MCP interaction, from initialization to termination.

Let's begin our exploration of MCP's architecture and core concepts, which will provide the foundation for the practical development we'll cover in Unit 3.
