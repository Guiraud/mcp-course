# MCP Clients

Now that we have a basic understanding of the Model Context Protocol, we can explore the essential role of MCP Clients in the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.

 In this part of Unit 1, we'll explore the essential role of MCP Clients in the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.

In this section, you will:

* Understand what MCP Clients are and their role in the MCP architecture
* Learn about the key responsibilities of MCP Clients
* Explore the major MCP Client implementations
* Discover how to use Hugging Face's MCP Client implementation
* See practical examples of MCP Client usage

## Understanding MCP Clients

MCP Clients are crucial components that act as the bridge between AI applications (Hosts) and external capabilities provided by MCP Servers. Think of the Host as your main application (like an AI assistant or IDE) and the Client as a specialized module within that Host responsible for handling MCP communications.

### Key Responsibilities

MCP Clients have several critical responsibilities:

1. **Connection Management**
   * Establishing and maintaining communication with MCP Servers
   * Supporting both local (stdio) and remote (HTTP+SSE) connections
   * Handling connection lifecycle events

2. **Capability Discovery**
   * Querying servers for available Tools, Resources, and Prompts
   * Maintaining up-to-date information about server capabilities
   * Providing capability information to the Host application

3. **Request Handling**
   * Formatting and sending JSON-RPC messages to servers
   * Managing request/response cycles
   * Handling errors and retries

4. **Protocol Management**
   * Implementing the MCP protocol specification
   * Managing message formatting and validation
   * Handling protocol versioning and compatibility

## Major MCP Client Implementations

### 5. Hugging Face Solutions

Hugging Face provides a robust MCP Client implementation through the `smolagents` library. The `smolagents.mcp_client.MCPClient` class offers:

#### Key Features
* **Flexible Connection Management**
  * Support for both stdio and SSE connections
  * Context manager support for automatic cleanup
  * Manual connection control options

* **Tool Integration**
  * Automatic tool discovery and registration
  * Support for multiple server connections
  * Multimodal data type handling

#### Usage Examples

1. **Basic Connection (Context Manager)**
```python
from smolagents.mcp_client import MCPClient
from mcp.client.stdio import StdioServerParameters

server_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uv",
    args=["--quiet", "some_mcp_server_package"]
)

with MCPClient(server_params) as tools:
    # Use the tools here
    print(f"Available tools: {tools.get_tools()}")
```

2. **Remote Server Connection**
```python
from smolagents.mcp_client import MCPClient

with MCPClient({"url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse"}) as tools:
    # Tools from the remote server are available
    print(f"Remote tools: {tools.get_tools()}")
```

3. **Multiple Server Connection**
```python
from smolagents.mcp_client import MCPClient
from mcp.client.stdio import StdioServerParameters

stdio_params = StdioServerParameters(
    command="uv",
    args=["--quiet", "server1_package"]
)
sse_params = {"url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse"}

mcp_client = MCPClient([stdio_params, sse_params])
try:
    mcp_client.connect()
    all_tools = mcp_client.get_tools()
    # Use tools from both servers
finally:
    mcp_client.disconnect()
```

## Best Practices

When working with MCP Clients, consider these best practices:

1. **Connection Management**
   * Use context managers (`with` statements) when possible
   * Implement proper error handling and cleanup
   * Monitor connection health

2. **Tool Usage**
   * Verify tool availability before use
   * Handle tool errors gracefully
   * Cache tool information when appropriate

3. **Security**
   * Only connect to trusted MCP Servers
   * Validate all server responses
   * Implement proper authentication when needed

## MCP SDKs

MCP is designed to be language-agnostic, and there are official SDKs available for several popular programming languages:

| Language | Repository | Maintainer(s) | Status |
|----------|------------|---------------|--------|
| TypeScript | [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) | Anthropic | Active |
| Python | [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) | Anthropic | Active |
| Java | [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk) | Spring AI (VMware) | Active |
| Kotlin | [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk) | JetBrains | Active |
| C# | [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/csharp-sdk) | Microsoft | Active (Preview) |
| Swift | [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/swift-sdk) | loopwork-ai | Active |
| Rust | [github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/rust-sdk) | Anthropic/Community | Active |

These SDKs provide language-specific abstractions that simplify working with the MCP protocol, allowing you to focus on implementing the core logic of your servers or clients rather than dealing with low-level protocol details.
