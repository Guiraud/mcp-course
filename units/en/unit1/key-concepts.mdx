# Key Concepts and Terminology

Before diving deeper into the Model Context Protocol, it's important to understand the key concepts and terminology that form the foundation of MCP. This section will introduce the fundamental ideas that underpin the protocol and provide a common vocabulary for discussing MCP implementations.

MCP is often described as the "USB-C for AI applications." Just as USB-C provides a standardized physical and logical interface for connecting various peripherals to computing devices, MCP offers a consistent protocol for linking AI models to external capabilities. This standardization benefits the entire ecosystem:

MCP benefits all stakeholders in the AI ecosystem: 
- users enjoy simpler, more consistent experiences across AI applications
- AI application developers gain easy integration with a growing ecosystem of tools and data sources
- tool and data providers need only create a single implementation that works with multiple AI applications
- the broader ecosystem benefits from increased interoperability, innovation, and reduced fragmentation

## The Integration Problem

The **M×N Integration Problem** refers to the challenge of connecting M different AI applications to N different external tools or data sources without a standardized approach. Without a protocol like MCP, developers would need to create M×N custom integrations—one for each possible pairing of an AI application with an external capability.

MCP transforms this into an M+N problem by providing a standard interface: each AI application implements the client side of MCP once, and each tool/data source implements the server side once. This dramatically reduces integration complexity and maintenance burden.

## The M+N Transformation

To visualize how MCP transforms the integration landscape, consider this comparison:

### Without MCP (M×N Problem)

Without MCP, each AI application would need to integrate with each tool/data source individually. This is a very complex and expensive process which introduces a lot of friction for developers, and high maintenance costs.

### With MCP (M+N Solution)

With MCP, each AI application implements the client side of MCP once, and each tool/data source implements the server side once. This dramatically reduces integration complexity and maintenance burden.

## Core MCP Terminology

Now that we understand the problem that MCP solves, let's dive into the core terminology and concepts that make up the MCP protocol.

<Tip>

MCP is a standard like HTTP, and is a protocol for connecting AI applications to external tools and data sources. Therefore, the terminology is crucial to using MCP effectively. 

When documenting our applications and communincating with the community, we should use the following terminology.

### Components

Just like client server relationships in HTTP, MCP has a client and a server.

- **Host**: The user-facing AI application that end-users interact with directly. Examples include Anthropic's Claude Desktop, AI-enhanced IDEs like Cursor, inference libraries like Hugging Face Python SDK, or custom applications built in libraries like LangChain. Hosts initiate connections to MCP Servers and orchestrate the overall flow between user requests, LLM processing, and external tools.

- **Client**: A component within the Host application that manages communication with a specific MCP Server. Each Client maintains a 1:1 connection with a single Server, handling the protocol-level details of MCP communication and acting as an intermediary between the Host's logic and the external Server.

- **Server**: An external program or service that exposes capabilities (Tools, Resources, Prompts) via the MCP protocol.

### Capabilities

Of course, your application's value is the sum of the capabilities it offers. So the capabilities are the most important part of your application. MCP's can connect with any software service, but there are some common capabilities that are used for AI applications.

- **Tools**: Executable functions that the AI model can invoke to perform actions or retrieve computed data. Typically relating to the use case of the application. For example, a tool for a weather application might be a function that returns the weather in a specific location.
- **Resources**: Read-only data sources that provide context without significant computation. For example, a researcher assistant might have a resource for a scientific papers.
- **Prompts**: Pre-defined templates or workflows that guide interactions between users, AI models, and the available capabilities. For example, a summarization prompt.
- **Sampling**: Server-initiated requests for the Client/Host to perform LLM interactions, enabling recursive actions where the LLM can review generated content and make further decisions.

### Conclusion

These interaction patterns are guided by several key principles that shape the design and evolution of MCP. The protocol emphasizes **standardization** by providing a universal protocol for AI connectivity, while maintaining **simplicity** by keeping the core protocol straightforward yet enabling advanced features. **Safety** is prioritized by requiring explicit user approval for sensitive operations, and discoverability enables dynamic discovery of capabilities. The protocol is built with **extensibility** in mind, supporting evolution through versioning and capability negotiation, and ensures **interoperability** across different implementations and environments.

Understanding these key concepts and terminology provides the foundation for working with MCP effectively. In the following sections, we'll build on this foundation to explore the architectural components, communication protocol, and capabilities that make up the Model Context Protocol.
