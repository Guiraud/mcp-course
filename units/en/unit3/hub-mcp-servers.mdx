# Working with MCP Servers on Hugging Face Hub

The Hugging Face Hub provides a centralized platform for discovering, sharing, and deploying MCP servers. This ecosystem approach dramatically simplifies working with MCP by providing a community-driven repository of reusable components.

## The MCP Server Ecosystem on Hugging Face

The Hugging Face Hub hosts a growing collection of MCP servers covering various functionalities:

- **Data Access Servers**: For accessing files, databases, and APIs
- **Tool Servers**: Providing utilities like code execution, data analysis, and web browsing
- **Integration Servers**: Connecting to third-party services like Slack, GitHub, and Google Workspace
- **Specialized Servers**: For domain-specific tasks like image generation, document processing, and more

This shared ecosystem eliminates the need to build common MCP servers from scratch, allowing developers to focus on their unique application requirements.

## Finding MCP Servers on the Hub

### Searching for MCP Servers

You can discover MCP servers on the Hugging Face Hub using:

1. **The Hub Search**: Visit [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co) and search for "mcp-server" or specific functionality like "mcp-server-github"
2. **Tags**: Browse servers tagged with "mcp", "mcp-server", or related categories
3. **Collections**: Explore curated collections of MCP servers for specific domains or use cases

### MCP Server Cards

Each MCP server on the Hub includes a detailed card with:

- **Description**: Overview of the server's functionality
- **Installation Instructions**: How to set up and run the server
- **Configuration Options**: Available settings and their default values
- **Authentication Requirements**: Details on required credentials or tokens
- **Examples**: Sample code for integrating the server into your applications
- **Limitations**: Known issues or constraints

These cards make it easy to evaluate and compare different servers to find the one that best meets your needs.

## Using Hub MCP Servers in Your Projects

### Installation

Most Hub MCP servers can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install "mcp-server-github @ git+https://huggingface.co/mcp-servers/github.git"
```

Or cloned directly:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/mcp-servers/github
cd github
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

Once installed, you can use a Hub MCP server like any other MCP server:

```python
# Python example using a GitHub MCP server from the Hub
from mcp.client import McpClient
from mcp_server_github import GitHubMcpServer

# Start the server
server = GitHubMcpServer(
    auth_token="your_github_token",
    repo_owner="your_username",
    repo_name="your_repo"
)
server.start()

# Connect a client
client = McpClient("github")
client.connect_to_server_stdio(server.get_stdio_connection())

# List available tools
tools = client.list_tools()
print(f"Available tools: {[tool.name for tool in tools]}")

# Call a tool
result = client.call_tool("create_issue", {
    "title": "Test issue",
    "body": "This is a test issue created via MCP"
})
print(f"Issue created: {result}")
```

### Configuration

Hub MCP servers typically offer various configuration options:

```python
# Example with comprehensive configuration
server = FileSystemMcpServer(
    root_directory="/path/to/files",
    allowed_extensions=[".txt", ".md", ".py"],
    read_only=True,
    max_file_size=10_000_000,  # 10MB
    concurrency_limit=5
)
```

The specific options available depend on the server, but they are documented in the server's Hub card and README.

## Contributing MCP Servers to the Hub

### Creating a New MCP Server

If you've developed an MCP server that might be useful to others, sharing it on the Hub is straightforward:

1. **Prepare Your Code**: Ensure your server is well-documented and follows MCP best practices
2. **Create a Repository**: Set up a new repository on the Hugging Face Hub using the web interface or the `huggingface-cli`
3. **Push Your Code**: Upload your server code to the repository
4. **Add a README**: Create a detailed README.md describing your server, its functionality, and usage instructions
5. **Add Tags**: Tag your repository with "mcp", "mcp-server", and other relevant tags

### Best Practices for Hub MCP Servers

When contributing to the Hub, follow these best practices:

1. **Standardized Structure**: Use a consistent project structure with a clear entry point
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Document all functionality, configuration options, and examples
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and meaningful error messages
4. **Security Considerations**: Document security implications and recommended precautions
5. **Version Management**: Use semantic versioning and maintain a changelog
6. **Tests**: Include tests to verify functionality and prevent regressions

Following these practices ensures your server is accessible and useful to the community.

## Example: Deploying a Hub MCP Server to Spaces

You can deploy MCP servers from the Hub to Hugging Face Spaces for easy access:

1. **Create a New Space**: Set up a Space using the Gradio or Streamlit framework
2. **Install the Server**: Add the server as a dependency in your requirements.txt
3. **Create a Web Interface**: Build a simple UI for configuring and using the server
4. **Deploy**: Push your code to the Space

This approach allows you to provide a user-friendly interface for your MCP server, making it accessible to users who may not be comfortable with command-line tools.

## Community Collaboration on MCP Servers

The Hugging Face Hub facilitates collaboration on MCP servers through:

1. **Discussions**: Engage with other developers on server functionality and improvements
2. **Pull Requests**: Contribute enhancements or fixes to existing servers
3. **Issue Tracking**: Report and track bugs or feature requests
4. **Version History**: View changes over time and roll back to previous versions if needed

This collaborative environment accelerates the development and refinement of MCP servers, benefiting the entire community.
